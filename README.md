## Installation

## Gameplay

Russian squares is a very challenging and fun logic game. Each game begins with a 4 by 4 block. Each time the clock runs down to zero another row or column is added to the block. Player gains points by elimating rows or columns. Scores enough points he will advance another level. Doing so will make game more difficult.

#### Objective

Try to make the big block disappear. Fill a column or row with one color and that column or row will dissapear. Player will gain points for each column or row they eliminate. If column or row is glowing player gains 4 times the points. Try to advance as far as you can. Climb the highscore list.

## Where do we go from here?

We don't. Sadly, I have no real intention of adding features, fixing bugs, or generally maintaining this application. It will forevermore remain in this incomplete state as a monument to times gone by.
